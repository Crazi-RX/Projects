            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>Scaredcrop is a youtuber who makes VR content mainly on a game called Gorilla Tag.
                Gorilla Tag is a game of tag. Yes, just a game of tag but it's not an ordinary game of tag.
                You are gorilla/monkey that moves with just your hands. You have to jump, climb and hop from tree
                to tree with just using your arms and hands. This game contains lots of sweat blood and tears.
                Mainly, just sweat, and tears. Make sure before playing this game you have a clear area to play in.
                Scaredcrop makes content every 2 days. Scaredcrop interacts with fans and users on Gorilla Tag and
                puts them in a challenge like Sharks and Minnows, Hide and Seek, Manhunt, Floor is Lava, and Extremely
                Fast Paced Game of Tag. He has an editor named Glitch. Glitch edits his videos and makes all the calls
                during the production process of videos. After the video is ready, ScaredCrop uploads the video. He repeats
                the process all over again.
