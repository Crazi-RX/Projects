Hello User! I am Jacob Rogers. The Developer of this program. I currently new and refreshing my mind around python. So this is a open-source program. Where you can edit my original source code to your needs or make it more efficient and This is PY-ATM! Currently since this is in the alpha stage. There will be a validation login screen before you can access the product. You need to go into the source code to see the username and password to continue. I will add multiple seperate files to make the application to run faster and make the code more concise. I will add an installer for the RAW files and .exe file version for people who don't have python installed. Every new version will add something new. From behind the curtains where users cannot see but for developers they can. From visual aspects of the program where users can see. The way users can see changes from version to version or update to the current version is the changelog. The changelog at the beginning of the program. After the version is upgraded. The changelog will be erased. Leaving new a message introducing the new version and what's new.
