## This is version v0.1.0!
-----------------------------------------
I am Jacob Rogers AKA Crazi-RX. I am the developer of this program. This is my first major project involving GUI (Graphical User Interface). This program is made with a module called Tkinter. Tkinter is a easy module to learn python and Graphical User Interfaces. I will be working on this project and PY-ATM. This program is in a alpha state. You might see unfinished areas of the program. Currently some places are not working and off limits. When you access these parts you will see a return button or it won't work at all.
